    <h1>EAT ME!</h1>
    <p>Dinner is served: is on the floor. I can't spoon-feed you anymore.</p>

    <h2>Homewrecker</h2>
    <blockquote>I'm only happy when I'm on the run. I break a million hearts just for fun. I don't belong to anyone. I guess you could say that my life's a mess. But I'm still looking pretty in this dress. I'm the image of deception. When Everything is life and death you may feel like there's nothing left. Instead of love and trust and laughter what you get is happy never after. But deep down all you want is love. The pure kind we all dream of. But we cannot escape the past. So you and I will never last.</blockquote>
