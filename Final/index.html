					<p>Vegans donut futurists believe that in the future, donuts will be totally vegan! Who knows, maybe robots will invent a machine that can turn wheat into dough and chocolate into icing, resulting in the perfect donut for all of us vegans.

And we're not the only ones excited about the prospect of a vegan donut future. Just take a look at this delicious selection of donut flavors from popular food chains like Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Kreme: Blueberry Muffin Donut, Cinnamon Sugar Donut, and Funfetti Donut. So if you're ready to make some sweet (and healthy!) culinary waves, get yourself some vegan donuts stat! <a href="">Read more about our story here.</a></p>
