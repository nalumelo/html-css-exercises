      <p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I'll be sure to use the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags I've been learning how to code.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>
        <p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a gret beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
